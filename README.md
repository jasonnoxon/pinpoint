## Pinpoint

The app I always build when I am learning a new technology is Pinpoint, which was the first web application I ever built. It's a simple in/out board where a user can change their status and see other people's statuses.

It was meant to be a tool for Administrative Assistants to handle incoming calls, but then it kind of turned into a big brother kind of thing.

It is written in ReactJS and uses Airtable (along with it's API) as it's backend.

## To Do

Logging in, editing your status. Web sockets? Who knows?!
